# THE SCHTICK: NICK TYPE SHIT
alright i have no idea how these fucks do this shit but whatever 

im nick but you can call me keithian (that is my stage name, i make music - ask me about it and ill send you links) 

or paul or methric or whatever the fuck really just as long as it isnt fucking stupid and i can actually tell youre talking to me

i apologize if this shit is awful im bad at talking about myself (wait... i dont apologize... GO FUCK YOURSELF!)

my main interests are mostly doing your mom, music production, music in general, playing games i guess and some other shit i cant be fucked to remember

my favorite music artists are eminem, d12, monoxide, jamie madrox, twiztid, shaggy 2 dope, violent j and insane clown posse (theres maybe also dr dre and a few others fuck it really just depends), BORDERLINE DISASTER

## DO NOT INTERACT / BEFORE YOU INTERACT SHIT
i dont have a do not interact list but if youve got a fucking brain then ill be happy to have you around

i block freely but i also just dont give a fuck half the time

if you got a problem with me then say it to my fuckin face

im really unpredictable sometimes so sorry if im cool and nonchalant one day and then fucking batshit the next thats just how it goes

i say swear words a lot so if you dont like that then you could probably just like FUCK OFF!

## LOVEMAIL I GUESS
lovemails are stupid
